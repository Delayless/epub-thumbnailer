What?
epub-thumbnailer is a simple script that tries to find a cover into an epub file and creates a thumbnail for it.

Why?
Because I want nautilus to display nice thumnails for my epub ebooks, as it does for pdf files

How to install?
1. Copy epub-thumbnailer.schemas to /usr/share/gconf/schemas/
sudo cp epub-thumbnailer /usr/share/gconf/schemas/

2. Install the schema
gconftool-2 --install-schema-file /usr/share/gconf/schemas/epub-thumbnailer

3. Restart nautilus
killall -9 nautilus && nautilus
